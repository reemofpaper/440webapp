        QUESTIONS 5 // 5 questions in this specific file

        11 Which is private member functions access scope? //id question
        4 1 ////number of options which answer is correct
        Member functions which can only be used within the class	// answer1
        Member functions which can used outside the class			 // answer2
        Member functions which are accessible in derived class		// answer3
        Member functions which can't be accessed inside the class	// answer4
        3 // num lines in desc
        The member functions can be accessed inside the class only if they are private.
        The access is scope is limited to ensure the security of the private members and their
        usage.


        12 Which among the following is true?
        4 2 ////number of options which answer is correct
        The private members can't be accessed by public members of the class
        The private members can be accessed by public members of the class
        The private members can be accessed only by the private members of the class
        The private members can't be accessed by the protected members of the class
        3 //num lines in desc
        The private members are accessible within the class. There is no restriction on use of private
        members by public or protected members. All the members can access the private member functions of
        the class.



        13 Which member can never be accessed by inherited classes?
        4 1 ////number of options which answer is correct
        Private member function
        Public member function
        Protected member function
        All can be accessed
        3 //num lines in desc
        The private member functions can never be accessed in the derived classes. The access specifiers is
        of maximum security that allows only the members of self class to access the private member
        functions.



        14 Which syntax among the following shows that a member is private in a class?
        4	2 	////number of options which answer is correct
        private: functionName(parameters)
        private(functionName(parameters))
        private functionName(parameters)
        private::functionName(parameters)
        2 // num lines in desc
        The function declaration must contain private keyword follower by the return type and function name.
        Private keyword is followed by normal function declaration.


        15 In java, which rule must be followed?
        4	4 	////number of options which answer is correct
        Keyword private preceding list of private member's
        Keyword private with a colon before list of private member's
        Keyword private with arrow before each private member
        Keyword private preceding each private member
        3 // num lines in desc
        The private keyword must be mentioned before each private member. Unlike the rule in C++ to specify
        private once and list all other private member's, in java all member declarations must be preceded
        by the keyword private.
